## Quick Start


### AI Coding Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc)
**Paste this into your coding agent** (Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex) and it'll set everything up:

```
Install the Gooseworks skills:

In the terminal, run `npx gooseworks install --all`.

Then run `npx gooseworks login` and it'll open a browser to sign in and set up the tools, then confirm it worked.

The skills can be used with /gooseworks <prompt>
```

### Claude Cowork

Run this command in a terminal first:
```
npx gooseworks install --all
```

Then authenticate:
```
npx gooseworks login
```

Then make sure you're working inside a local folder on your machine, and then you can use the skills in Cowork like this:
```
Use /gooseworks skill to generate some ad creatives
```


### Install manually
Prefer to run it yourself? Use the command directly:

```bash
npx gooseworks install --all       # All detected agents
```

This gives your coding agent access to the **full catalog of 200+ skills**. After installing, just ask your agent to use any skill by name.

> If you want a cloud-based AI coworker that already knows all these skills and more, sign up to [Gooseworks](https://app.gooseworks.ai)

npx gooseworks search "reddit scraping"   # Search the skill catalog

## Security & Trust

These skills run inside your coding agent, so it's worth knowing exactly what they do:

- **Open source & inspectable.** Every skill — its `SKILL.md` instructions and all scripts — lives in this repo under the MIT license. The `gooseworks` CLI fetches skills at runtime so recipes stay current, but the source you'd run is right here to read, diff, or pin before you run it.
- **Scripts run locally.** Skill scripts execute on your machine and write to `/tmp/gooseworks-scripts/`, never into your project directory. Only API requests go through GooseWorks servers; review any script before letting your agent run it.
- **Your agent stays in control.** The skills are a tool your agent reaches for when it fits the task (data at scale, sources behind auth, a specific provider) — not a replacement for its built-in web search or fetch on quick lookups. You can read or edit any installed `SKILL.md` to tune that behavior.
- **Credentials stay local.** Auth is a Bearer token stored at `~/.gooseworks/credentials.json` (file mode `0600`). Third-party provider keys (Apify, Apollo, etc.) are held server-side — your token never touches them. All network calls are HTTPS.
- **The MCP server is opt-in.** Registering the GooseWorks MCP server is off by default; it only happens if you explicitly run `gooseworks install --mcp`.
